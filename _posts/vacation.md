I believe my college life came to an end in April 2020. That was my sophomore year, and I embarked on a journey back to my home to escape the pandemic. I spent a year taking online classes and decided to graduate early. After that, I chose to take a year off at home. Counting from time of leaving for the U.S. to my new graduate school career next month, I experienced one vacation of approximately two and a half years. \
Since I began my college education, I had never spent such an extended period at home. While at school, I could spend up to 10 hours a day on campus, but with online classes, everything was done in my own room, except for necessary activities outside. So, even though I was still literally as a student in school, I felt like I was on a break, with online classes being the only aspect that required additional attention. \
In a brief evaluation of this two-and-a-half-year period, I found it to be very comfortable and enjoyable. I didn't have to worry about the basics of life, such as food, living, and transportation. I didn't have to be concerned about my financial situation or the pandemic crisis. Every day, I had accompanied by family and friends, and I could sleep and play games for as much time as I wanted. Although I occasionally realized, "This can't continue!", I still didn't make any significant changes. I just enjoyed everything I had.
This lifestyle helped me escape from reality. \
Something happened on me in my sophomore year: neurological tinnitus, eye floaters, dizziness. \
Even though I always avoided discussing this topic every day, these symptoms could affect my mood at any time. What is silence, what is a flawless sky, what is a clear mind—these were senses I couldn't feel anymore. I felt that I was gradually drifting away from the world of ordinary people.
I remember that when I first developed these symptoms two years ago, I was devastated when I learned that there were no effective treatment options. I constantly complained to family and friends, even writing a lengthy post on social media to vent my pain, seeking a momentary comfort to numb myself. I believed that with time, I could accept everything and return to a normal life. Looking back today, two years later, I have indeed continued to lead a normal life, but I still can't fully accept this reality. \
Over the past two years, I found an excellent way to avoid my awareness: sleeping, sleeping, and more sleeping. I slept, woke up, and then went back to sleep. I could get up to 10 hours of sleep in a day. During sleep, I didn't have to feel or worry about anything. Apart from sleep, I also tried to develop some new interests and hobbies to pass the time, shift my focus, and enrich my inner world. Through these efforts, I significantly reduced the impact of these persistent symptoms on my mood. \
However, I wasn't happy. Every day when I opened social media and saw my classmates sharing their excited life, I would favor their posts, but I became upset. I felt like I was living with a foggy brain and aimless mind. I seemed as immature as a ten-year-old by comparing myself to others to find contentment. \
I want to express my gratitude for my recent 2.5 years. They have allowed me to deeply reexamine myself: what kind of life I truly desire, and what kind of person I want to become. In truth, the specific answers don't matter. It's just simply letting go of thoughts, living each day to the fullest, and being prepared to embrace new journeys at any moment. I want to learn more, see more, and feel more: this composes my life’s meaning.

[Comment in November 2023]: Thanks to my surrounding people, with their supports I overcame this mental issue and accepted everything happens on me. I hope everyone who reads this note can be always happy.
